Description: DBI is a powerful and the standard package to interface
    relational database management systems (RBDMS). For most users,
    however, it might still be cumbersome to manage database
    connections, send SQL queries to and obtain their results from an
    RDBMS. With this package, we aim to make some tasks easier for R
    users working on conventional RDBMSs.
